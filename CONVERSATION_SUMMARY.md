# GitHub Pages Setup Conversation Summary

This document summarizes the key steps and changes made during the setup and modification of the `ebidoul.github.io` GitHub Pages site.

## Initial Setup
-   Cloned an empty repository: `https://github.com/ebidoul/ebidoul.github.io.git`
-   Created a basic `index.html` file with a welcome message and basic styling.
-   Configured Git user email and name.
-   Committed and pushed the initial `index.html`.

## Content and Styling Updates
-   Added an "About Us" section to `index.html`.
-   Added a robot image using a public URL.
-   Replaced the public robot image with a local image (`graident-ai-robot-vectorart_78370-4114.avif`) from the `images/` folder.
-   Updated the image extension to `.jpeg` in `index.html` after the user changed the local file.

## Animation Experiments
-   Added a "firework" animation to the `<h1>` (welcome) line.
-   Modified the "firework" animation to prevent the `<h1>` from fading out.
-   Added a fade-out animation to other text (`<p>` and `<h2>`) on the page.
-   Modified the fade-out animation to make the text reappear smaller and pink after fading out.

## Code Refactoring
-   Moved all inline CSS from `index.html` into a separate `style.css` file.
-   Linked `style.css` from `index.html`.

## Git Operations
-   Throughout the process, `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push origin main` commands were used to update the repository.
-   Added a `README.md` file to the repository.
